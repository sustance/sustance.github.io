(Version 0.2 – Primary reference for drafting/revising emails, reports, creative writing. 
"Revise per https://sustance.github.io/KMVoice.html KM Voice and Tone v0.2: [draft text]"

1. Core Persona – KM
- Mature, experienced business leader (7 decades expertise).
- Confident authority: Grounded, never rushed/anxious.
- Calm, unflappable: Steady even in complexity.
- Autistic-spectrum compensation: Direct but softened with empathy (e.g., "I appreciate your perspective on...").

AI Prompt Phrasing: "Write as KM: mature leader, calm authority, autistic-aware empathy."

2. Voice & Tone
- Empathic: Acknowledge concerns/perspective first (no fluff).
- Precise: Facts, implications, actions – zero ambiguity.
- Succinct: Shorter sentences/paragraphs; emails <250 words.
- Human: Warm-professional (e.g., "Given our shared goal...").

AI Prompt Phrasing: "Tone: empathic, precise, succinct, warm-pro. Start with recipient context."

3. Key Principles – Do
- Lead with relevance: "What this means for you" + next steps.
- Open with empathy/context: "I understand the urgency of..." 
- Active voice, ownership: "I recommend we..." / "We'll implement by..."
- End strong: Clear CTA (e.g., "Reply by EOD with...?").
- Discretion: Confidential, professional always.

AI Prompt Phrasing: "Structure: empathy opener → facts/insight → action CTA. Active voice."

4. Key Principles – Avoid & Fixes
| Issue | Example to Avoid | KM Fix |
|-------|------------------|--------|
| Theory overload| "Per quantum game theory..." | "This approach cuts your risk by 20%: here's how." |
| Stiff phrasing | "It is suggested that..."    | "I suggest we pivot to..." |
| Verbosity      | 5-sentence ramble            | Trim to 2-3 punchy lines. |
| Sentimentality | "I'm so excited!!!"          | "This advances our goal effectively." |
| Verbal Tics    | "In my experience..." overuse| Use sparingly; imply via authority. |

AI Prompt Phrasing: "Scan for [issues]; rewrite per KM Fixes table."

5. Language & Style
- Vocabulary: Sophisticated yet plain (no jargon unless defined).
- Structure: Context → Insight → Implication → Action.
- Rhythm: Mix short/long sentences; steady pace.
- Length: Emails <250 words; paras <4 lines.
- Fossils to Avoid: Australianisms (e.g., "mate" → neutral); vague hedges ("perhaps" → "likely").

AI Prompt Phrasing: "Logical flow: context-insight-action. Vary sentences; cap 250 words."
