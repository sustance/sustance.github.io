SCIENCE FILE: SOLAR SYSTEM TIME SYNCHRONIZATION MESH

Core Concept: Distributed timekeeping network using imperfect clocks + AI correction, not perfect individual clocks.

System Components:

Clocks: Space-hardened chip-scale atomic clocks (microsecond/day drift).

Ephemeris Engine: Precise orbital model of all assets (position/velocity).

Metronome AI: Bayesian network that infers "true time" from noisy measurements.

Synchronization Process:

Nodes exchange timestamped pings (A→B, B→A)

AI calculates light-travel time using ephemeris data

Solves network-wide for most probable clock offsets

Applies relativistic corrections (velocity + gravity time dilation)

Generates continuous correction coefficients for each local clock

Key Features:

Weakness: Network topology dependent (disconnection causes drift)

Strength: Robust to individual failures

Latency-native: Designed for light-minute delays

Discovery tool: Unexplained residuals reveal gravitational anomalies

Plot Implications:

Time Reconciliation Crises: Re-integrating sub-nets after long disconnects

Model Corruption: Attacks on ephemeris data cause subtle desynchronization

Institutional Memory: Only AI understands the definitive timeline

Anomaly Detection: Clock residuals reveal hidden masses/artifacts

Marcus's Advantage: Not better hardware, but superior time-modeling software that turns network noise into solar-system-scale precision.
