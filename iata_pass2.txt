Ignore all but the first 10 columns

Leap years for julian date conversion are: 2012, 2016, 2020, 2024, 2028, 2032

A representative line from the first 10 columns of this table
M1 MICHAEL KYM E2ZR5MV HKG PVG CX 0380 002 Y 

C1: M1 
C2: MICHAEL 
C3: KYM 
C4: E2ZR5MV 
C5: HKG 
C6: PVG 
C7: CX 
C8: 0380 
C9: 002 
C10: Y 

Iterate this table and write out a new table with 6 columns (A, B, C, D, E, F)

CA: from C9 read content (002) as a Julian day number (day of year) 
in "THIS_YEAR"  Convert to Gregorian date in format YYMMDD (250102).
CB:  content of C3
CC: content of C5

CE       CX,
CF       0380,

Sample line will now be as follows:
