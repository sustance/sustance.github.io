      <h2>Offer Laptop/Mini PC</h2>
      <p>
        Do you have a physically functional laptop or mini PC that is currently unusable, often because its proprietary Windows or Mac OS is no longer supported or upgradable?  
        We invite you to list it here to connect with volunteers who can upgrade it with a free open source operating system like Ubuntu, XFCE, or FreeBSD.
      </p>
      <p>
                We will not warehouse, stock or deliver machines. Volunteers will need to hold them in 
                their own home so ancillary equipment (Screens, keyboards etc.) large devices are generally excluded. 
                Small devices and power block only!. Not Phones or Pads.
