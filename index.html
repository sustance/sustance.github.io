    we will expose them to potential volunteers for free and open source upgrade 
    and revival and subsequent donation to individuals or charities.</p>

  <p>Your anonymous listing of what you have or want will be linked to a unique 
    code for matching in a social media group (WhatsApp). 
    Do not provide personal identifying or location information in 
    any public listing form fields.
    To physically exchanging goods do not communicate in the chat 
    group use your private privately chat of mail.
    We will try to recruit commmunity, charity etc locations for anonymous dropoff 
    or pickup can be done just using the listing codes.
    This system is not for money or harvesting your data. We never want know who you 
    are and hopefully you dont ever need to know your counterparty.

      <h2>Offer Laptop/Mini PC</h2>
      <p>
        Do you have a physically functional laptop or mini PC that is currently unusable, often because its proprietary Windows or Mac OS is no longer supported or upgradable?  
        We invite you to list it here to connect with volunteers who can upgrade it with a free open source operating system like Ubuntu, XFCE, or FreeBSD.
      </p>
      <p>We can not warehouse, stock or deliver machines. 
        Volunteers will need to hold them in their own home so ancillary 
        equipment (Screens, keyboards etc.) and large devices are excluded for now.
