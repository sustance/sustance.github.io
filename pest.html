List all Chinese Companies manufacturing autonomous robotic agricultural row crop weeding and pest managementmachine manufacturers

<li>1. Shandong Ucarry Machinery Co., Ltd.<br>
Product: Autonomous Robot Sprayer (URS250B)<br>

Key Features:<br>

250L tank capacity, gasoline-electric hybrid power<br>

Remote control (200m range), adjustable spraying angle<br>

Suitable for complex terrains (mountains, slopes) 1.

<li>2. MQ Autonomous Agritech<br>
Product: M200 Electric Autonomous Sprayer<br>
<br>
Key Features:

Designed for orchards, vineyards, and greenhouses<br>

200L tank, 16m spray width, electric drivetrain<br>

Swappable lithium battery (20-30 min runtime) 3.

<li>3. XAG
Products:<br>

R150 Unmanned Ground Vehicle (for spraying, mowing, and broadcasting)<br>

P Series Agricultural Drones (P40, P80 for precision spraying)<br>

Key Features:<br>

AI-powered prescription maps for variable-rate spraying<br>

Lightweight, adaptable to smallholder farms and hilly terrains 8.

<li>4. Linyi-based Manufacturer (Unnamed)
Product: 700L Self-Propelled Boom Sprayer<br>

Key Features:<br>

4WD, 15m spray width, mechanical weeding attachments<br>

Optional fertilizer spreader (350L capacity) 9.

<li>5. FJ Dynamics
Note: Mentioned in a review of agricultural robotics but lacks specific product details in the search results 15.<br>

Key Observations:<br>
Chinese manufacturers focus on sprayers (liquid pest management) rather than mechanical/laser weeding robots like Western companies (e.g., Carbon Robotics).<br>

XAG and MQ Autonomous Agritech stand out for integrating AI and multi-functional capabilities (e.g., spraying + seeding) 38.<br>

Smaller firms like Shandong Ucarry emphasize cost-effective, rugged designs for local markets 19.
